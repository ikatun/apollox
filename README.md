# apollox
MobX graphql client

## Commands:

### apollox download:schema url
  Downloads graphql schema to `schema.json` file using `https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo`

### apollox generate:types
  Creates typescript types for all queries inside the project against `schema.json` schema.
  Queries must be written inside `*queries.ts` files using `gql` literal and exported as variables.

### apollox generate:store
  Generates `src/graphql/graphql-store.ts` MobX store containing all the queries and mutations.

### apollox generate:everything url
  Executes `download:schema`, `generate:types` and `generate:store`.

### apollox generate:queries url
  Creates `src/graphql/generated-qql` directory containing all the mutations, queries and subscriptions which exist on the server.
  It skips those that already exist in the client project.
  Schema is automatically pulled from the server before code is autogenerated.
